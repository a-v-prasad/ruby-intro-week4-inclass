# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 1-data.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of data:

# Numbers
#puts 3
#puts 2
#puts 2+3
#puts 2-3
#puts 5*3
#puts 5.0/3
#puts 5% 3

# Non-numbers
# puts "hello, world"

# True, False
# puts true
# puts false

# Nothing

# Variables
# Store in memory a value - want to refer to the value multiple times. should be lowercase
# x = 3
# y = 5
# puts x
# puts y
# puts x*y

food = "tacos"
#puts food

#puts food + " are delish"


#can combine nonnumeric values
#make variables descriptive

#has to be all lowercase with the _ to differentiate b/w words

# Combine strings and variables
#puts food + " are delish"

#an example of interpolation - only works when types are the same - can't combine string + number
#puts "#{food} are delish!"

#puts "#{3*5} are delish!"
#can multiply within

#puts food * 3


# String manipulation
# the .upcase gets performed on the variable
puts food.upcase
puts food.reverse
puts food.length
